Today I decided to move my website to a next platform as my old Express.js site, only had minification at runtime. This negatively affected load times and put additional strain on my Raspberry Pi 3B+. I decided on Next.js as it offered static compiled pages and also server-side rendering which I was acustomed to from Express.js. Furthermore, this framework allowed me to use React.js which has tons of libraries that give you access to pre-built UI/UX components.

Initially I will be hosting the website via <a href="https://www.vercel.com">Vercel</a>, atleast until I am ready to deploy and switch entirely from my old site. In terms of final deployment I may stick with Vercel or I may move to a VPS with <a href="https://www.ovh.com/">OVH</a> as they offer the best value for money I could find in the $10USD/month range.

To start my journey with Next.js and React.js I used the <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app">blog tutorial</a> to learn how to make my first few pages. After completing the tutorial, I reskinned the UI by adding some of my favourite colours and styling from my old website. Additionally, I found some packages to make a hamburger menu that slides in from the left. This is the main menu you see on the left.

Going forward I am planning to move some of my existing webservices to this platform and also to start building some authentication and admin panels for such applications. 

I hope that you will join me for this adventure!
